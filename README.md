# MathTrainer3000
Level up your Math Skills!!!

--- This is a DOTNET project. If you can't do anything with this information, ignore it, some people will understand :)

You want to refresh your math skills and get a little Training in Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division?

In that case, the [MathTrainer 3000] is exactly the right program for YOU to go with. In the sourcecode, which everyone can open with a normal editor, if he*she isn't that much into program, there are some lines with little notes above them, that is the location where you're able to range the range of the numbers and also which opperations you want to be included in YOUR personal Training.

If you find some errors with the code, obviously, you can contact me as always on Discord: iTz_Marsi#1381 (Begin the message with GitHub/ProjectName (in this case GitHub/MathTrainer)

Thanks for using my programs, helping to improve them and also help me improving my programming skills with those little projects.

Enjoy!!!
